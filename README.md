# Zone3Termostat
3 zone wireless termostat with 433MHz sensors T25

In project based on Arduino UNO I'm using 3 wireless 433MHz sensors Sencor T25 for control one boiler by relay.
Possible is use 5 programs with 6 steps per day with own temperature. Implemented is also RTC for use real time.
Each zone is possible independent turn on or off. For zone is possible also set date and time for delay start.
Here is used also LCD1602 ROBO shiels with 5 buttons + reset.

For sensors T25 I'm using my own library  https://github.com/miklik72/SensorT25.
